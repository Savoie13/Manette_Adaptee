/*
  Full_controller

  Controls the mouse from a joystick and keyboard keys (A,W,S,D) with boutons on an Arduino Leonardo, Micro or Due.
  
  Uses the joystick's push button to click the left mouse button.

  Hardware:
  - 2-axis joystick connected to pins A0 and A1
  - 5 pushbuttons connected to pin D15, D10, D14, D9 and D16

  The mouse movement is always relative. This sketch reads two analog inputs
  that range from 0 to 1023 (or less on either end) and translates them into
  ranges of -6 to 6.
  The sketch assumes that the joystick resting values are around the middle of
  the range, but that they vary within a threshold.

  WARNING: When you use the Mouse.move() command, the Arduino takes over your
  mouse! Make sure you have control before you use the command. This sketch
  includes a pushbutton to toggle the mouse control state, so you can turn on
  and off mouse control.
